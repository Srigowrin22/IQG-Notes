Day 2 : 

	Module-15 : React JS 
	
		
		What is a Component ?
		
			A Component is a full Functional Software Unit.
			
			Every Component has a Limited Duty to be Self Consistent.
			
			Real Time Eg : Building Blocks.
			
			Problems in Traditional Applications
			
				1.  Wastage of the Resources
				
				2.  No Resuablity 
			
			
			Most of the Application Except Most of the Things to Happen on the Same Page
			
			[ SPA ] : Single Page Applications

			Applications are Now Made Up Of Components 
			
			
			In Server Side Application we Achieve the Same Using [ JSP/JSF ( Fragments / Segments ) ]
			
			
			Components in React
			
			A Component has 2 Parts
			
			1.  View Part of the Application [ HTML  and CSS ]
			
			2.  ViewModel Part of the Application [ JS ( Data Events and Operations ) ]
			
			Interpolation = Binding Data on to the UI 
			
				{ } 
			
			
			Components are UserDefined [ Remember Custom Tags in JSP ]
			
			
			React JS is Completely Based On Component Based Development. 
			
			React JS Uses MVC 
			
			
			Root Component [ App ]
			
				1.  View Part [ HTML & CSS ]
				
				2.  Model Part [ JS ]
				
			
			In React component 
			
				1. View Part [ CSS ]
				
				2. ViewModel [ HTML and JS ] Together 
			
			
			Component is Custom Tag 
			
				<ReactAppView id="" name="" style=""> 
				
				<ReactAppView/>
				
				
			ChildComponent : Body Content of the Tag 
			
								Body Content Can Have [ Just Text / Sub Tags ]
								
								
			Installation of React 
			
			1.  Using a Facebook Provided Template 
			
				npm install -g create-react-app
				
				a. Creating React Application Using Template
				
					npx create-react-app <appname> 
					
					[ Application name is Case Sensitive ( Always in Lower Case ) , Can Have Dash Styled { app-name }) ]
					
					
			
			2.  Using Yarn
			
				yarn create-react-app <appname>
				
			3.  Gatsby
			
			4.  Remix
			
			5.  Expo
			
			6.  Using CDN [ Content Developer Network ]
			
				<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
				<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

				<!-- Don't use this in production: -->
				<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
						
					
					
			Different Ways for Creating React App
			
			1. Using CDN 
			
				Without JSX
				
				With JSX
				
				
			2.  Using the Template [ As a Component Based Development ]
			
				Create a Simple Component 
				
					import React from 'react';
					
					class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
					
						render() {
							return <h1> Hello, World </h1>
						}
					}
					export default Hello
					
					Using Dynamic Value
					
					import React from 'react';
					
					class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
					
						render() {
							return <h1> Hello, {this.props.name} ! </h1>
						}
					}
					export default Hello
					
					
					How to Use This Reusable Component 
					
					Either in index.js 
					
					import Hello from './Hello'
					
					// Without Passing Props
					ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('helloDiv'));

										// Without Passing Props
					ReactDOM.render(<Hello name="Rahul" />, document.getElementById('helloDiv'));
