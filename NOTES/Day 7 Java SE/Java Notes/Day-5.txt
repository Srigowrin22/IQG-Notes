			Lesson 10 : Java IO 
			
				So When we Operate on Files 
			
				1.  File
						
						An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
				
				2.  FileDescriptor
				
				3.  FileInputStream
				
				4.  FileOutputStream
				
				
				Reading and Writing Objects
				
					Serialization : 
					
						Is a Process of Writing the State of the Objects on Some Persistence Storage Media [ Files / Or Any Storage ].
						
							State --- Attributes
				
					DeSerialization : 
					
						Is a Process of Reading the State of the Objects From Some Persistence Storage Media [ Files / Or Any Storage ].
						
							State --- Attributes
				
				
					Transient ( Variable )
					
						Transient is an Access Modifier Used on Variables, Its Feature is the Variable which is Marked Transient is Excluded From Serialization
						
						[ When Serialization Happens, That Data Associated to the Variable is Not Saved in Persistence Storage Media ]
				
				
				
		Lesson 11 : Inheritance
				
					1.  Reusability    [ Using Attributes and Operations From Parent ]
					
					2.  Expandability  [ Adding New Attributes and Operations ]
					
					
					Becoz of Inheritance All Properties and Methods [ Irrespective of Modifiers ] are 
					
					1.  Availability  [ Everything is Available to Derived Class ]
					
					2.  Accessiblity  [ But What is Accessible What is Not Accessible is All Depending on the Modifier ]
					
					
					Super Reference
					
					1.  Can Be Used for Accessing Base Class Constructors
					
					2.  Can Even Used for Accessing Base Class Variables
						[ When Both The classes Have Same Variable name ]
						
					3.  Can Even Be used for Accessing Base Class Methods
						[ While Sub Class is Overriding the Method of Base Class, But Still it needs the Defination of Base Class ] 
					
					
					
					Overriding Usage 
					
					class DBMSOperations
					{
					
						public void connectToDB() {
							Connects to Oracle DB
						}
						
						public void executeOnDB() {
							SELECT
						}
						
						public void disconnectFromDB() {
							Disconnects From Oracle DB
						}
					}
					
					
					class InsertOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							INSERT 
							super.executeOnDB();
						}
					}
					
					class UpdateOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							UPDATE 
							super.executeOnDB();
						}
					}
					
					class DeleteOperations extends DBMSOperations 
					{
						public void executeOnDB() {
							DELETE
							super.executeOnDB();
						}
					}
					
					
				Treating Sub Class As its Super Class
				
					int i = 123;
					
					float f = 456.78f;
					
					f = i;  // f = 123.0f;
					
					i = (int)f;  //i = 456; 
					
			Final     ( Variable, Method & Class )
			
				Final on Variable = Constant 
				
				Final on Method   = Overriding NOT POSSIBLE 
				
				Final on Class    = Inheritance NOT POSSIBLE 
				
				
				
	ON TMS
	
		1.  Clerk Generates a Report , The Report Data Should Be Stored in the Folder [ Monthwise ] Then Store the Data in a File
		
		2.  Proof Will be an Image 
		
		3.  Load OwnerDetails and VehicleDetails [ Given By Dealer in the XML Form / Any Other Form, So RTO Can Read this File Later Push This Data into DB [ Rather Doing a Data Entry Job ]
