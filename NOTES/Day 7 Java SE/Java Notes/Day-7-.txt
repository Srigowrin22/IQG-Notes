			Lesson 14 : Exception Handling
			
				What is an Exception ?
				
					An Exception is a Condition Which is Usually Occurred Either at Compilation Phase or Execution Phase, but Whatever may be the Case, It Leads into Abrupt Termination
					
					Types :
					
						1.  Compile Time Exception  [ Checked Exception ]
						
						2.  Run Time Exception [ UnChecked Exception ]
						
					Causes of Exception 
					
						1.  Invalid User Input
						
						2.  Design Errors
						
						3.  IO Errors 
						
						
				Usage of Finally 
				
				try
				{
					OpenFile
					ReadWriteContentsToFile
				
				}
				catch(ExceptionType1 E1)
				{
					E1.printStackTrace();
					return;
				}
				catch(ExceptionType1 E1)
				{
					E1.printStackTrace();
				}
				catch(ExceptionType1 E1)
				{
					E1.printStackTrace();
				}
				finally
				{
					CloseFile
				}
				
				
			Try Without Resource 
			
				try
				{
					InputStream in = new FileInputStream(SomeFile);
					...
					
					in.close();
				}
				
			Try Without Resource 
			
				try ( InputStream in = new FileInputStream(SomeFile); )
				{
					
					...
					No Need to Release Resource ( Try With Resource AutoCloses ]
					
				}
				
				
			Lesson 15 : JDBC
		
			Why Prepared Statement ?
			
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'JAVA';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'TESTING';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'PHP';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = '.NET';
				
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = 'C#';
				
				
			Reason Behind Prepared Statement [ Performance Improvement ]
			
				Instead of Converting the Whole Query FROM JAVA TO SQL 
				
				PreparedStatement maintains a PreCompiled QUERY [ Most Part of the Query Which is Common ]
				
				Only the Portion of the Query Which needs to Changed can be Parameterized and Only that Can be Converted From Java to SQL 
			
				SELECT * FROM LINKSTABLE WHERE SEARCH = ?;
				
				
				
			Design Pattern 
			
				What is a Design  Pattern ?
				
					A Design Pattern is a Set of Guide Lines Given By One Developer to Another Developer in the S/W Industry for Recurring Problems 
					
				DAO [ Data Access Object ] Pattern 
				
				Factory Pattern 
				
					Is a Simple Class Involved with Creation of Objects
					
					public interface 
					
					
					public class DepartmentDAOFactory
					{
						private DepartmentDAO departmentDAORef;
